setup new Next.js project - create-next-app

you don't have to deal with things like React Router, 
and building multi-page websites is as simple as just creating a new file under the pages/ folder and Next will automatically generate a route based on the filename for you.
If you add more files under the pages folder, for example a file named about.js - it will be available at YOUR_DOMAIN/about

You can also do multilevel routing by creating subfolders under the pages/ folder. 
For example, something like pages/tracks/freshman.js will have the route YOUR_DOMAIN/tracks/freshman

pages/api folder. Unlike regular pages, which render HTML views, anything under the pages/api folder acts as an API endpoint.

Let's look at the autogenerated pages/api/hello.js file:

export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
}

This is a very Express-like function. If you were to go to YOUR_DOMAIN/api/hello - 
instead of rendering an HTML view, this will return a JSON object {name: 'John Doe'} - which is a super simple API endpoint.
